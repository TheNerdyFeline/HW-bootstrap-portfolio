This is the basic-portfolio using bootstrap. I ran into some problems. On the portfolio page in order to get the overlapping labels to be the full width of the image.  I ended up using 5 columns instead of 6 so I could remove the paddin. I then offset the columns on the right to get the layout I wanted.  This allowed me to use the built in 100% width to get the responsive portfoloi I wanted.
